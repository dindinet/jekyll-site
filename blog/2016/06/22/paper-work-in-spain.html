  <h1>Paper Work in Spain</h1>
<p class="meta">22 Jun 2016</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>Like in the UK you have to keep on top of the paper work.  Paying the utilities, insuring the car and the home paying local taxes and getting registered at the doctors. Most of the utlity companies have a help desk especially for English speakers and the banks website is also available in English. SO pretty much a walk in the park. The biggest job you have to do is get your NIE number which most estate agents organise when you are buying your house. Check and double check</p>

<p>Utilities are paid by standing order. Check.
Insurance premiums to English staffed broker by online transfer. Check.
Doctor visits. Take UK Health card to desk give details and receive Spanish Health service card in two weeks. Check.</p>

<p>Wow that was easy. Oh that leaves me time for a quick spin on the bicycle up the hill and back before lunch. I might get another glimpse of the Eagle I saw at the weekend.</p>

<p>Hom hum. How is the rain in blighty?</p>

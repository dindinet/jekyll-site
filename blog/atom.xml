   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since moving into our new home in the Costa Blanca our life has changed for the better. We have slowed down and speeded up. we are more relaxed but we do more. We have lots of time for a very fulfilling social life, we spend lots of quality time with the grand kids and of course we have heeps of me time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play golf as often as 3 times a week. The weather is always golf weather except for a few days in the winter when I would rather be sat in front of our open log fire reading all the books my lovely wife June bought me for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June has become a gardening fiend. She is enjoying all the plants she couldnâ€™t grow at home in the UK. New scents new colours and everything grows so fast. Here in Spain buying quite mature trees is the done thing. They are not at all expensive and the almost instant transformation fromplot to garden is quite joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
